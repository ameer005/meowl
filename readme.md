# 🐾 Meowl (WIP)

> A tiny, handcrafted search engine written in Go — because why use Google when you can waste your weekends building a janky cat-themed one?

## 💡 Overview

**Meowl** is an experimental search engine project that aims to:

- Crawl the web (like a curious cat)
- Index the content (not just yarn and cardboard boxes)
- Rank it with TF-IDF and PageRank
- And serve it to you through a vintage web interface

> Let's see if I'm going to finish it or not. 😼

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

If you're reading this and the project is complete:  
**either I became a legend… or someone else got tired of waiting and finished Meowl themselves.**
